## March 6, 2025 - Search Interface Addition

### Feature Implementation
I've added a web-based search interface to allow direct searching of Ordpedia memories:

1. **Search Interface**:
   - Created a user-friendly web interface at http://localhost:4444
   - Allows searching across all memories or filtering by specific pages
   - Configurable result limit (5 to 100 results)
   - Highlighting of search terms in results

2. **Server Components**:
   - Added Express.js server (`search-server.js`) on port 4444 to serve the interface
   - Implemented API endpoints to proxy memory search requests to Python backend
   - Added page listing functionality to populate the dropdown filter

3. **Python API Enhancement**:
   - Added `/pages` endpoint to retrieve approved pages for the interface
   - Maintains existing memory search functionality through proxy

4. **Startup Integration**:
   - Updated `start.sh` to launch the search interface alongside other services
   - Proper cleanup of all processes on shutdown

This search interface provides a convenient way to directly search and test the memory system without needing to use the API directly.

## March 6, 2025 - Memory Sync Optimization

### Problem
The system was correctly identifying pages that were already synced to GitHub during the initial GitHub sync phase, skipping those that were already in sync. However, the memory sync process was not implementing the same efficiency checks, causing it to unnecessarily delete and re-add memories for all pages during startup, even if those memories were already up-to-date.

This inefficiency was confirmed by reviewing the logs which showed:
1. GitHub sync correctly reporting "Page already synced to GitHub and Memory, skipping"
2. Memory sync unconditionally processing all pages with "Syncing page to memory..."
3. Deletion and re-addition of memories for each page, taking significant time (20-30 seconds per page)

The audit tool (`auditSync.ts`) was reporting that pages were fully synced based solely on the presence of memories, without verifying if those memories corresponded to the latest approved revision.

### Solution Implemented
I've enhanced the system to track and verify memory sync status relative to page revisions:

1. **Schema Enhancement**:
   - Added a `last_memory_synced_revision_number` column to the `pages` table to track which revision is reflected in the current memories

2. **Memory Sync Logic Optimization**:
   - Modified `initialMemorySync.ts` to check if existing memories match the latest approved revision
   - Implemented a skip condition to avoid unnecessary deletion and re-addition of memories
   - Updated the revision tracker after successful syncs

3. **Audit Tool Refinement**:
   - Enhanced `auditSync.ts` to check if memories correspond to the latest revision
   - Improved reporting to distinguish between existing but outdated memories and fully synced memories

4. **Migration Helper**:
   - Added `initRevisionTracking.ts` script to initialize revision tracking for existing pages
   - For pages that already have memories, it sets the tracker to match their latest revision
   - This avoids unnecessary resyncing of all pages after adding the new column

This solution preserves all data integrity while significantly improving startup performance by eliminating redundant memory operations. The system now handles both GitHub and memory sync with equal efficiency.

### Benefits
- Reduced startup time by skipping unnecessary memory operations
- Improved system efficiency and reduced API calls/database load
- Enhanced audit accuracy with proper revision tracking
- Consistent redundancy check approach across GitHub and memory sync processes
- Smooth migration path for existing data
